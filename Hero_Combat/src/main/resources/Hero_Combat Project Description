The Java Project Hero_Combat seems to be to provide an interface where the program can get certain combat stats from a character (e.g., Dodge DV). It contains twenty-six source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of one (1) line comment, and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
