The Java Project Magic_Description seems to be about the descriptions for magic (presumably including charms, spells, and evocations). It contains thirty-seven source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of ten (10) line comments (three of which say "nothing to do"), and one (1) JavaDoc comment.

I will scrap this project.
