The Java Project Character_Cards seems to be a system for organizing character data for forming PDFs for printing. It contains twenty-six source files, with a cumulative total of 35 line comments (two "nothing to do") and 1 block comment (which is a segment of code not for compilation, rather than a comment as such).

Since I don't know how to form PDFs, I will salvage this project to learn; possibly, some of it will be usable without radical adjustment.
