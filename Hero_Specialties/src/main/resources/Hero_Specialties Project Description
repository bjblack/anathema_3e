The Java Project Hero_Specialties seems to be the system for ability specialties. It contains thirty-six source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of three (3) line comments (one of which says "nothing to do"), and one (1) block comment.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
