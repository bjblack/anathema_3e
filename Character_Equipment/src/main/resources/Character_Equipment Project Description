The Java Project Character_Equipment sounds like a system for defining equipment, with weapons and armor and all stats associated therewith. It is not implemented in the program yet, so it is presumed to be incomplete. It contains forty-three source files (excluding test packages), with a cumulative total of 2 line comments (both "nothing to do").

My recode shall leave much more customization to the user, so I will scrap this project.
