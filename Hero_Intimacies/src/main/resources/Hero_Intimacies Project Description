The Java Project Hero_Intimacies seems to implement character Intimacies. Functionally speaking, it seems to be complete, except for effects to social influence (because social influence is not implemented). It contains twenty source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of one (1) line comments (which says "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
