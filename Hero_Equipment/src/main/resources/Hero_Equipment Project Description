The Java Project Hero_Equipment seems to be a system for defining, displaying, and editing equipment. It contains ninety-six source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of eight (8) line comments (three of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

I will keep this project for reference. It's certain to be difficult to unravel, but may be insightful when I create my Equipment Editor.
