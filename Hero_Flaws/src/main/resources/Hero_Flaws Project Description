The Java Project Hero_Flaws seems to be a system for describing Flaws. It's probably more or less the same as Merits, just displayed in a different location. It contains eighteen source files, with a cumulative total of zero comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
