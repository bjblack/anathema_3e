
The Java Project Hero_Attributes seems to be a system for adding attribute functionality to the Hero interface. It contains thirty-eight source files, with a cumulative total of two (2) line comments (one of which says "nothing to do").

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
