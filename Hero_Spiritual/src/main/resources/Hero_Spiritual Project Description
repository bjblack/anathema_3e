
The Java Project Hero_Spiritual seems to be the system for attaching Essence rating and Willpower to characters. It contains sixty-six source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of two (2) line comments (both of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
