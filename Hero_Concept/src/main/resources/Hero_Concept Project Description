The Java Project Hero_Concept seems to be a system for attaching concepts to characters, and displaying them. It contains sixty-one source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of three (3) line comments (one of which says "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
