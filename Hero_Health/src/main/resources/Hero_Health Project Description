The Java Project Hero_Health seems to implement the existence of health tracks, and has incomplete code for characters taking damage and healing. It contains twenty-seven source files, with a cumulative total of four (4) line comments (two of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
