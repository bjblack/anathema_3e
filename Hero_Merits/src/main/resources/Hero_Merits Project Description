The Java Project Hero_Merits seems to be the system of attaching merits to characters. It contains forty-nine source files, with a cumulative total of four (4) line comments (two of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
