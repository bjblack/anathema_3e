The Java Project Engine_Exalted seems to be an extension of Engine_Character, which produces characters meeting certain minimum requirements for Exalted, namely Essence and Attribute values. It contains twelve source files, with a cumulative total of two (2) line comments.

Since I will scrap the super project, I will scrap this project.
