The Java Project Platform_FX contains a bunch of bullshit that's impossible to sort out. It contains fifty-nine source files, with a cumulative total of eleven (11) line comments (five of which say "nothing to do"), and one (1) block comment.

Anathema.java's Anathema.startApplication is the effective starting point of the program, called by the boot loader.

I will set this project aside for reference purposes, especially the Anathema class.
