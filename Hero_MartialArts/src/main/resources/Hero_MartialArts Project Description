The Java Project Hero_MartialArts seems to implement martial arts in general. The data of the specific styles is contained in JSON files or some such. It contains fourteen source files, with a cumulative total of two (2) line comments (one of which says "nothing to do"), and zero (0) other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
