The Java Project Book_Core contains resources for other projects. It contains no code.

These resources are in Properties format (if the file extension is .properties), or in JSON format, or, if the file extension is .template (except *MeritPoints_*.template, which is in JSON format), some form of JSON-like format I don't recognize (GSON perhaps).

I assess that this project will be entirely worthless.
