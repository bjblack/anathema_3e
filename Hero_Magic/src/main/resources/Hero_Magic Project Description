The Java Project Hero_Magic seems to be the system for giving characters magic abilities, the exact medium of which I cannot discern, though it seems to connect in to Charms and Spells, at the very least. It contains sixty-nine source files, with a cumulative total of four (4) line comments (three of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
