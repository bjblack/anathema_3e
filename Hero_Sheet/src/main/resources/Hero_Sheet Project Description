The Java Project Hero_Sheet largely relates to translating character traits to PDF files. It implements one setting, being page size (A4 or Letter). It contains one hundred thirty-one source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of six (6) line comments (two of which say "nothing to do"), and one (1) JavaDoc comment.

I will set this project aside for reference purposes.
