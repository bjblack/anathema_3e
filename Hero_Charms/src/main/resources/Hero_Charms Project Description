The Java Project Hero_Charms seems to be a system to implement charms. It contains two hundred eighteen source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of twenty-seven (27) line comments (sixteen of which say "nothing to do") and two (2) block comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
