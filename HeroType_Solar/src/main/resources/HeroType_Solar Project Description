The Java Project HeroType_Solar seems to be the system for describing unique aspects of Solar Exalts, namely how the Great Curse affects them and their anima displays. It contains twenty-four source files, with a cumulative total of one (1) line comments (which says "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

I will scrap this project.
