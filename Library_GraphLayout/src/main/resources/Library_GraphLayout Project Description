The Java Project Library_GraphLayout seems to be a system for graphing charm cascades. It contains thirty-two source files (excluding test files), with a cumulative total of five (5) line comments (four of which say "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

Class and function names and a comment in the test files refer to someone named Sugiyama, and a book he wrote.

The package is net.sf.anathema.graph, instead of net.sf.anathema.library.graph, which might have been a better fit to naming conventions.

I will set this project aside for reference purposes.
