The Java Project Hero_Experience seems to be the system wherethrough a character can gain and spend Experience. At the moment, has no distinct categories for Pure Experience and Solar Experience. It contains seven source files, with a cumulative total of two (2) line comments (one of which says "nothing to do"), and no other comments.

As a sub-project of Hero, which I am scrapping, I will scrap this project.
